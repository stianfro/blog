My name is Stian and I am employed at [Intility](https://intility.com) where I have been working professionally with Linux for eight years and Kubernetes for about seven years.

On this blog I will try to share some of the knowledge on topics that interest me.

I also sometimes write blog posts over at [engineering.intility.com](http://engineering.intility.com/).
